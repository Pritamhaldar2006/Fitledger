## 📖 Project Description

**FitLedger** is a simple beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract that allows users to **store their daily fitness logs immutably** on the blockchain.  
Each user’s workout records are securely tied to their wallet address — ensuring privacy, transparency, and permanence.  

Perfect for anyone learning how to build decentralized applications (dApps) and exploring how blockchain can be used for **personal data tracking**.

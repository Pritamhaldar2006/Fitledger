### Your Immutable Fitness Journal on the Blockchain

---

## üìñ Project Description

**FitLedger** is a simple beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract that allows users to **store their daily fitness logs immutably** on the blockchain.  
Each user‚Äôs workout records are securely tied to their wallet address ‚Äî ensuring privacy, transparency, and permanence.  

Perfect for anyone learning how to build decentralized applications (dApps) and exploring how blockchain can be used for **personal data tracking**.
